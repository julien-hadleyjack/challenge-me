#title: Rotate image
#source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
#description: >
#  Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes,
#  write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
#tests:
#  - {input: here is some text, output: "here%20is%20some%20text"}

title: Erase matrix row and column
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: >
  Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0,
  its entire row and column is set to 0.
tests:
  - {input: "1 2 3 4, 5 6 7 8, 9 0 0 0", output: "1 2 0 0, 5 6 0 0, 0 0 0 0"}
  - {input: 5, output: 5}
  - input: "123 68 21 67, 985 62 0 4, 637 2 3 96, 357 0 9 4, 368 75 2 7"
    output: "123 0 01 67, 0 0 0 0, 637 0 0 96, 0 0 0 0, 368 0 0 7"
